        "Magic like you’ve never heard
        AirPods Pro have been designed to deliver Active Noise Cancellation for immersive sound, Transparency mode so you can hear your surroundings and a customisable fit for all-day comfort. Just like AirPods, AirPods Pro connect like magic to your iPhone or Apple Watch. And they’re ready to use straight out of the case.
        
        Active Noise Cancellation
        Incredibly light, noise-cancelling headphones, AirPods Pro block out your environment so you can focus on what you՚re listening to. AirPods Pro use two microphones, an outward-facing microphone and an inward-facing microphone, to create superior noise cancellation. By continuously adapting to the geometry of your ear and the fit of the ear tips, Active Noise Cancellation silences the world to keep you fully tuned in to your music, podcasts and calls.
        
        Transparency mode
        Switch to Transparency mode and AirPods Pro let the outside sound in, allowing you to hear and connect to your surroundings. Outward- and inward-facing microphones enable AirPods Pro to undo the sound-isolating effect of the silicone tips so things sound and feel natural, like when you’re talking to people around you.
        
        All-new design
        AirPods Pro offer a more customisable fit with three sizes of flexible silicone tips to choose from. With an internal taper, they conform to the shape of your ear, securing your AirPods Pro in place and creating an exceptional seal for superior noise cancellation
        
        Amazing audio quality
        A custom-built high-excursion, low-distortion driver delivers powerful bass. A super-efficient high dynamic range amplifier produces pure, incredibly clear sound while also extending battery life. And Adaptive EQ automatically tunes music to suit the shape of your ear for a rich, consistent listening experience.
        
        Even more magical
        The Apple-designed H1 chip delivers incredibly low audio latency. A force sensor on the stem makes it easy to control music and calls, and switch between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode. Announce Messages with Siri gives you the option to have Siri read your messages through your AirPods. And with Audio Sharing, you and a friend can share the same audio stream on two sets of AirPods — so you can play a game, watch a film or listen to a song together.",

        It packs a powerful NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 graphics all set for Full HD gaming in high detail. And with the IPS screen, you can expect vivid colours and sharp contrasts - just what you need for immersive gaming.
        
        Plus, the 256 GB SSD means you can eliminate boot up times and blast through loading screens.

        With IPS screen technology you can expect vivid colours, sharp contrast and amazing brightness. What's more, it has wide viewing angles, so you can enjoy all that even looking from the sides.
        
        Stays cool under pressure
        
        Featuring twin fans and dual exhausts, the Nitro 5 stays cool in the heat of the action. Acer's CoolBoost technology increases fan speeds by up to 10% at critical moments, so you won't have to worry about your laptop overheating.
        
        With the NitroSense app you can also easily adjust and monitor fan speeds any time with one simple press of the hotkey.
        
        WiFi 6 & Killer Ethernet
        
        When competing online, a split second can decide the whole match. With WiFi 6 you'll get a stable connection for lag-free gaming with minimal latency. And if you need absolute reliability and speed, you can go wired with the Killer Ethernet port.
